# Analysis-on-predicting-Diabetics-using-ML
Diabetes-Prediction-Project

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning models. It analyzes medical and lifestyle-related features of patients to classify whether they are likely to have diabetes.

Key Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step workflow

Files Included

Diabetes.ipynb → Complete model-building pipeline

Diabetes_Prediction.pdf → Project report with explanations

Objective

To build an accurate and interpretable machine learning system that can assist in early detection of diabetes and support healthcare decision-making.
